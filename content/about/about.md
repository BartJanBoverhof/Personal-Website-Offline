My name is Bart-Jan. I am graduated student of [Methodology and Statistics](https://www.uu.nl/masters/en/methodology-and-statistics-behavioural-biomedical-and-social-sciences) at Utrecht University. My interest mostly lies in machine learning & deep-learning. I very much enjoy to disentangle a certain subject: something to which research in the fields of statistics & data science lends itself perfectly. The rabbit-hole like nature that characterises these fields implies that there is always something more to learn.

My interest in statistics was initially kindled as undergraduate Sociology student at Utrecht University. Whilst studying Sociology, I already quickly realized that statistics sparked my interest the most. Luckily, my program allowed for a lot of freedom with regards to electives, which led me to take quite a bit of statistics courses. I finally wrote my [Bachelor-Thesis](https://dspace.library.uu.nl/handle/1874/392915) on *Hidden Markov Models* at the department of Methods and Statistics, and realized statistics was something I’d love to pursue further.

Right after finishing my bachelor, I started the Methods & Statistics research master, also at Utrecht University. After watching a documentary [AlphaGo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXuK6gekU1Y), my interest in deep learning was kindled. I continued to pursue this interest further in my second year, namely in my masterthesis project, an internship at [ASReview](https://asreview.nl/), as well as several university courses. For a more extensive elaboration on my masterthesis project & internship, please *see [projects](https://bartjanboverhof.github.io/projects/projects/)*.
