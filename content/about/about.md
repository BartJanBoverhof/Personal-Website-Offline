I am Bart-Jan. I’m a student of statistics. Recently, I’ve also started studying deep-learning. Why stats? And why deep-learning? I thoroughly enjoy to disentangle something. Going to the bottom of things provides a lot of statisfaction. In my experience, statistics lends itself perfectly for getting to the bottom of stuff.

The rabbit-hole like nature of statistics implies there is always something else to delve into deeper. When you think you finally know it all, something new appears on the horizon. I hope, that my path down through the rabbit-hole is a journey that will never cease to exist.

My intrest in statistics was initially kindled during my Sociology bachelor at Utrecht University. Whilst studying Sociology, I already quickly realized that statistics sparked my interest the most. Luckily, my programme allowed for a lot of freedom with regards to courses, which led me to take quite a bit of statistics courses. I finally wrote my [Bachelor-Thesis](https://dspace.library.uu.nl/handle/1874/392915) on *Hidden Markov Models* at the department of Methods and Statistics, and realized statistics was something I'd love to pursue further further.

Right after finishing my bachelor, I started the Methods & Statistics research master, also at Utrecht University. As of yet, I am still in the middle of this. After watching a documantary on [AlphaGo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXuK6gekU1Y), my interest in deep-learning was kindled. I continuted to pursue this interest in my second year, namely by writing my [Masterthesis](https://github.com/BartJanBoverhof/Masterthesis) on deep-learning. In this project, we aim to create a multi-modular deep-learning framework for the classification of workload based on several different bio-signal sensors.
