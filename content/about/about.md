I am Bart-Jan. Iâ€™m a graduate student of methods and statistics at Utrecht University. My interest mostly lies in machine-learning, or more specific, deep-learning. I highly enjoy to disentangle a certain subject. Statistical research lends itself perfectly for getting to the bottom of stuff. This rabbit-hole like nature implies that there is always something more. When you think you finally know it all, something new appears on the horizon.

My intrest in statistics was initially kindled as undergraduate Sociology student at Utrecht University. Whilst studying Sociology, I already quickly realized that statistics sparked my interest the most. Luckily, my programme allowed for a quite lot of freedom with respect to electives, which led me to take quite a bit of statistics courses. I finally wrote my [Bachelor-Thesis](https://dspace.library.uu.nl/handle/1874/392915) on *Hidden Markov Models* at the department of Methods and Statistics, and realized statistics was something I'd love to pursue further further.

Right after finishing my bachelor, I started the Methods & Statistics research master, also at Utrecht University. After watching a documantary on [AlphaGo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXuK6gekU1Y), my interest in deep-learning was kindled. I continuted to pursue this interest in my second year, namely by focusing on deep-learning in my Masterthesis. In this project, we aim to create a multi-modular deep-learning framework for the prediction of workload by means of several bio-signal sensors *(see also [projects](https://bartjanboverhof.github.io/projects/projects/) for more information)*.
