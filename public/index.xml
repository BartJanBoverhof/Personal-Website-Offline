      <description>I am Bart-Jan. I’m a student of statistics. Recently, I’ve also started studying deep-learning. Why stats? And why deep-learning? I thoroughly enjoy to disentangle something. Going to the bottom of things provides a lot of statisfaction. In my experience, statistics lends itself perfectly for getting to the bottom of stuff.
The rabbit-hole like nature of statistics implies there is always something else to delve into deeper. When you think you finally know it all, something new appears on the horizon.</description>
