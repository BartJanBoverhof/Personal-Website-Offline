![Thesis](/images/old.jpeg)

I am PhD candidate at the [Erasmus School of Health Policy & Management](https://www.eur.nl/en/eshpm) at Erasmus University. My research interests are in the evaluation of clinical Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems, AI in general and Statistics 

This interest in statistics was initially kindled as undergraduate Sociology student at Utrecht University. Whilst studying Sociology, I already quickly realised that statistics sparked my interest the most. Luckily, my program allowed for a lot of freedom with regards to electives, which led me to take quite a bit of statistics courses. I finally wrote my [Bachelor-Thesis](https://dspace.library.uu.nl/handle/1874/392915) on *Hidden Markov Models* at the department of Methods and Statistics, and realized statistics was something I’d love to pursue further.

After finishing my bachelor, I started the Methods & Statistics research master, also at Utrecht University. After watching a documentary [AlphaGo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXuK6gekU1Y), my interest in deep learning was kindled. I continued to pursue this interest further in my second year, namely in my masterthesis project, an internship at [ASReview](https://asreview.nl/), as well as several university courses. For a more extensive elaboration on my masterthesis project & internship, please *see [projects](https://bartjanboverhof.github.io/projects/projects/)*.
