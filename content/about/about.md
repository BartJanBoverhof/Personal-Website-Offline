My name is Bart-Jan. Iâ€™m graduated student of [Metdodology and Statistics](https://www.uu.nl/masters/en/methodology-and-statistics-behavioural-biomedical-and-social-sciences) at Utrecht University. My interest mostly lies in machine learning & deep-learning. I very much enjoy to disentangle a certain subject: something to which research in the fields of statistics & data science lends itself perfectly. This rabbit-hole like nature implies that there is always something more to learn.

My intrest in statistics was initially kindled as undergraduate Sociology student at Utrecht University. Whilst studying Sociology, I already quickly realized that statistics sparked my interest the most. Luckily, my programme allowed for a quite lot of freedom with respect to electives, which led me to take quite a bit of statistics courses. I finally wrote my [Bachelor-Thesis](https://dspace.library.uu.nl/handle/1874/392915) on *Hidden Markov Models* at the department of Methods and Statistics, and realized statistics was something I'd love to pursue further further.

Right after finishing my bachelor, I started the Methods & Statistics research master, also at Utrecht University. After watching a documantary on [AlphaGo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXuK6gekU1Y), my interest in deep learning was kindled. I continuted to pursue this interest further in my second year, namely in my masterthesis project, an internship at [ASReview](https://asreview.nl/) and several university courses. For a more exstensive ellaboration on my masterthesis project & internship, please *see [projects](https://bartjanboverhof.github.io/projects/projects/)*.
